# Trending Page Improvements Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Real Politician Names in Trending Topics
**Problem**: Trending topics page was showing generic names like "Politician 12-1", "Politician 12-2" instead of real politician names.

**Solution**: 
- Updated `src/pages/trending/TrendingTopics.tsx` to import `mockPoliticians` from the mock data
- Modified the `generateTrendingTopicsData` function to use real politician names from the mock data
- Changed the related politicians generation to randomly select from actual politicians:

```typescript
relatedPoliticians: Array.from({ length: Math.floor(Math.random() * 5) + 1 }, () => {
  const randomPolitician = mockPoliticians[Math.floor(Math.random() * mockPoliticians.length)];
  return {
    id: randomPolitician.id,
    name: randomPolitician.name,
    party: randomPolitician.party
  };
}),
```

**Result**: Trending topics now show real politician names like "Peter Obi", "Bola Ahmed Tinubu", "Atiku Abubakar", etc.

### 2. Real Politician Names in Recently Viewed Sidebar
**Problem**: Recently viewed sidebar was showing "Politician pol_001" instead of actual politician names.

**Solution**:
- Updated `src/components/layout/Sidebar.tsx` to import `mockPoliticians`
- Modified the recently viewed section to look up actual politician data:

```typescript
{recentPoliticians.slice(0, 5).map((politicianId: string) => {
  const politician = mockPoliticians.find(p => p.id === politicianId);
  const displayName = politician ? politician.name : `Politician ${politicianId}`;
  const initials = politician ? 
    `${politician.firstName.charAt(0)}${politician.lastName.charAt(0)}`.toUpperCase() :
    politicianId.slice(0, 2).toUpperCase();
  
  return (
    <Link key={politicianId} to={`/politician/${politicianId}`}>
      <span className="truncate">{displayName}</span>
    </Link>
  );
})}
```

**Result**: Recently viewed sidebar now shows real politician names and proper initials.

### 3. Added Refresh Button to Trending Topics Page
**Problem**: No way to refresh trending topics data without page reload.

**Solution**:
- Added `ArrowPathIcon` import from Heroicons
- Added refresh functionality using React Query's `refetch` method
- Added refresh button with loading state and animation:

```typescript
const { data: trendingData, isLoading, refetch } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['trending-topics', timeframe],
  queryFn: async () => {
    await mockApiDelay(800);
    return generateTrendingTopicsData();
  }
});

const handleRefresh = () => {
  refetch();
};

// In the JSX:
<button
  onClick={handleRefresh}
  disabled={isLoading}
  className="btn-secondary inline-flex items-center disabled:opacity-50 disabled:cursor-not-allowed"
>
  <ArrowPathIcon className={`h-4 w-4 mr-2 ${isLoading ? 'animate-spin' : ''}`} />
  Refresh
</button>
```

**Result**: Users can now refresh trending topics data with a dedicated button that shows loading state.
