## Usage Examples

```tsx
// Mobile-optimized politician card
<PoliticianCard 
  politician={politician}
  enhancedData={enhancedData}
  showEnhanced={true}
/>

// Mobile filter interface
<MobileFilterButton 
  showEnhancedFilters={true}
  variant="primary"
/>

// Touch-friendly chart
<TouchFriendlyChart
  data={chartData}
  enableZoom={true}
  enablePan={true}
  enableTooltipOnTouch={true}
>
  <LineChart data={data}>
    {/* Chart components */}
  </LineChart>
</TouchFriendlyChart>

// Responsive analysis grid
<ResponsiveAnalysisGrid variant="charts">
  <ChartComponent1 />
  <ChartComponent2 />
  <ChartComponent3 />
</ResponsiveAnalysisGrid>
```

## Configuration

Mobile behavior can be customized through the `MOBILE_CHART_CONFIG` object:

```typescript
const config = {
  heights: {
    mobile: { small: 200, medium: 250, large: 300 },
    tablet: { small: 250, medium: 300, large: 400 }
  },
  touch: {
    swipeThreshold: 50,
    pinchThreshold: 0.1,
    tapTimeout: 300
  }
};
```

## Future Enhancements
- Voice navigation support
- Haptic feedback integration
- Advanced gesture recognition
- Offline capability for mobile users
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features

This implementation ensures that all multi-dimensional sentiment analysis features are fully accessible and optimized for mobile users, providing a seamless experience across all device types.
