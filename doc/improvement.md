})

// 2. Create theme CSS variables
:root {
  --bg-primary: #ffffff;
  --text-primary: #111827;
}

[data-theme="dark"] {
  --bg-primary: #1f2937;
  --text-primary: #f9fafb;
}

// 3. Update components to use CSS variables
className="bg-[var(--bg-primary)] text-[var(--text-primary)]"
```

### Search Implementation

```typescript
// 1. Install and configure Fuse.js
import Fuse from "fuse.js";

const fuse = new Fuse(politicians, {
  keys: ["name", "party", "state", "position"],
  threshold: 0.3,
});

// 2. Implement real search logic
const searchResults = fuse.search(query);
```

### Mock Data Optimization

```typescript
// 1. Enhance mock data loading
const { data: politicians } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["politicians", filters],
  queryFn: async () => {
    await mockApiDelay(300); // Realistic delay
    return mockSearchWithFilters(mockPoliticians, filters, [
      "name",
      "party",
      "state",
    ]);
  },
});

// 2. Add mock error scenarios
const simulateApiError = (errorRate = 0.1) => {
  if (Math.random() < errorRate) {
    throw new Error("Simulated network error");
  }
};
```
