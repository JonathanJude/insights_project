# Insight Intelligence Dashboard - Project Planning

## üéØ Product Goals

### Primary Objective
Build a comprehensive React-based dashboard that provides real-time sentiment analysis and insights about Nigerian politicians across multiple social media platforms.

### Target Users
- **Journalists**: Research public opinion trends for news stories
- **Political Researchers**: Academic analysis of political sentiment
- **Voters**: Informed decision-making based on public sentiment
- **Campaign Managers**: Monitor public perception of candidates
- **Policy Analysts**: Track reaction to political decisions

## üìä Core Value Propositions

1. **Multi-Platform Aggregation**: Unified view across Facebook, Twitter/X, Instagram, Threads
2. **Demographic Insights**: Breakdown by gender, age group, state, political level
3. **Real-Time Sentiment**: Live sentiment tracking with historical trends
4. **Interactive Filtering**: Dynamic data exploration with multiple filter combinations
5. **Comparative Analysis**: Side-by-side politician and party comparisons

## üöÄ MVP vs Full Version

### MVP Features (Phase 1)
- Basic politician search and profile view
- Simple sentiment charts (positive/negative/neutral)
- Platform breakdown visualization
- Basic demographic filters (gender, age, state)
- Mock data integration for UI development

### Full Version Features (Phase 2+)
- Real-time data streaming
- Advanced sentiment analysis with emotion detection
- Geographical heatmaps
- Trend prediction algorithms
- Export functionality (PDF reports)
- User authentication and saved searches
- Mobile-responsive design
- Dark mode toggle

## ü§î Open Questions & Dependencies

### Data Pipeline Questions
1. **Social Media APIs**: Do we have access tokens for Facebook, Twitter, Instagram APIs?
2. **Rate Limits**: What are the API rate limits and how do we handle them?
3. **Data Storage**: Where will processed sentiment data be stored? (PostgreSQL, MongoDB?)
4. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket implementation for live data streaming?

### Technical Architecture Questions
1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Will we use:
   - Third-party APIs (AWS Comprehend, Google Cloud NLP)?
   - Custom ML models?
   - Hybrid approach?
2. **Demographics Data**: How do we infer age/gender from social media profiles?
3. **Caching Strategy**: Redis for frequently accessed politician data?
4. **CDN**: Image hosting for politician photos?

### Compliance & Ethics
1. **Data Privacy**: GDPR/local privacy law compliance
2. **API Terms**: Compliance with social media platform terms of service
3. **Data Retention**: How long do we store social media data?
4. **Bias Mitigation**: How do we handle algorithmic bias in sentiment analysis?

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Stack Decisions

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS + Shadcn/ui components
- **Charts**: Recharts (lightweight, React-native)
- **State Management**: Zustand (simpler than Redux for this scope)
- **API Layer**: React Query + Axios
- **Routing**: React Router v6

### Development Tools
- **Build Tool**: Vite (faster than Create React App)
- **Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library
- **Linting**: ESLint + Prettier
- **Type Checking**: TypeScript strict mode
