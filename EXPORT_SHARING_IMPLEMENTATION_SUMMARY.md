  - Total politicians count
  - Total mentions
  - Average sentiment scores
  - Sentiment distribution percentages
  - Export timestamp and time range

### 3. Shareable Links
- **State Preservation**: Complete filter state encoding in URLs
- **Base64 Encoding**: Secure and compact state serialization
- **Clipboard Integration**: One-click link copying with fallback support
- **State Restoration**: Automatic filter application from shared links

### 4. User Interface Components

#### ExportButton Component
- Dropdown menu with all export format options
- Integrated share functionality
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
- Error handling and loading states
- Disabled states for unavailable formats

#### DashboardExportButton Component
- Specialized button for dashboard statistics export

- Configurable sizing and styling

### 5. Enhanced Chart Components
Updated all chart components to include export functionality:
- **SentimentChart**: Export with time range filters
- **PlatformBreakdown**: Export with platform-specific data
- **DemographicsChart**: Export with demographic breakdowns

## Technical Implementation

### Core Classes

#### ChartExporter
```typescript
class ChartExporter {
  async exportAsPNG(): Promise<void>
  async exportAsSVG(): Promise<void>
  async exportAsPDF(): Promise<void>
  exportAsCSV(): void
}
```

#### DashboardExporter
```typescript
class DashboardExporter {
  exportToCSV(): void
}
```

#### ShareableLinkGenerator
```typescript
class ShareableLinkGenerator {
  static generateShareableLink(state: ShareableState): string
  static parseShareableLink(shareParam: string): ShareableState | null
  static copyToClipboard(link: string): Promise<void>
}
```

### Utility Functions
- `exportChart()`: Main export function for all chart types
- `exportDashboardStats()`: Dashboard statistics export
- `generateShareableLink()`: Create shareable URLs
- `copyShareableLink()`: Copy links to clipboard

### State Management Integration
- **Filter Store Integration**: Automatic filter state capture
- **URL Parameter Handling**: Seamless shared state loading
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during state restoration

## Performance Achievements

### Export Performance
- All export operations complete within 10 seconds (requirement met)
- Large datasets (1000+ records) handled efficiently
- Concurrent exports supported without performance degradation

### Memory Efficiency
- Proper cleanup of blob URLs and temporary elements
- Minimal memory footprint during export operations
- Efficient data serialization for shareable links

## Error Handling

### Robust Error Management
- Graceful handling of missing chart elements
- Malformed data protection with filtering
- Network failure recovery for clipboard operations
- User-friendly error messages and retry options

### Fallback Mechanisms
- Alternative clipboard methods for older browsers
- Console logging when notifications unavailable
- Default export formats when specific formats fail

## Testing Coverage

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **18 test cases** covering all functionality
