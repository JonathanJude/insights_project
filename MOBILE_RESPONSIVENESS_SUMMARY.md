### Touch Event Handling
```typescript
// Example implementation in chart components
const handleTouchStart = useCallback((e: React.TouchEvent) => {
  setTouchEnd(null);
  setTouchStart(e.targetTouches[0].clientX);
}, []);

const handleTouchEnd = useCallback(() => {
  if (!touchStart || !touchEnd) return;
  const distance = touchStart - touchEnd;
  const isLeftSwipe = distance > 50;
  const isRightSwipe = distance < -50;
  // Handle swipe navigation
}, [touchStart, touchEnd]);
```

## üì± Mobile-Specific Features

### Responsive Chart Behavior
- **Mobile**: Horizontal button controls, smaller charts, simplified legends
