# Party Analytics Page Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### 1. Missing Import
**Problem**: The `generateFilteredDemographicsData` function was not imported in `PartyAnalytics.tsx`
**Solution**: Added the missing import to the mock data imports

### 2. Empty Demographics Data
**Problem**: The DemographicsChart components were receiving empty arrays instead of actual data
**Solution**: 
- Updated the DemographicsChart components to use the actual `demographicsData` from the query
- Set `showFilters={false}` to prevent duplicate filter controls

### 3. Missing Export in Mock Index
**Problem**: The `generateFilteredDemographicsData` function wasn't exported from the mock index file
**Solution**: Added the function to the exports in `src/mock/index.ts`

### 4. TypeScript Errors
**Problem**: Several TypeScript errors in chart components
**Solution**: 
- Fixed type annotations in `DemographicsChart.tsx` for array methods
- Fixed import issue in `PlatformBreakdown.tsx` by separating type and value imports
- Fixed type casting in `PartyDistributionChart.tsx`

### 5. Broken Comment Syntax
**Problem**: A broken comment in `sentimentData.ts` was causing build errors
**Solution**: Fixed the comment syntax

### 6. Filter Integration
**Problem**: Filters weren't properly connected to the PartyCompareChart
**Solution**: Added `selectedParties` prop to the PartyCompareChart component
